Social Media Screen Time Reduction App
	1.	Use apps which track the amount of time students spend on social media (can use existing platforms like Screen Zen).
	2.	Includes a school-wide leaderboard ranking users based on screen time — less time spent ranks higher (similar to how YPT tracks progress).
	3.	Students who top the leaderboard each month will receive incentives.
	4.	The combination of incentives and peer competition encourages students to reduce their social media use and engage with the app.
	5.	Student leaders can promote the app and liaise with school leadership for resources and funding to support implementation.
	6.	**Case studies** Anti-scroll apps like "one sec" report a _57% average reduction_ in usage. Apps like Screen Zen maintain high ratings (4.8 stars with 167 reviews), indicating positive user reception.
	7.	Corporations can adopt features like Instagram’s Teen Accounts, which include Sleep Mode (10pm–7am) and usage reminders after 60 minutes.
	8.	**Sustainability**: Low maintenance cost; can be managed by school infocomm clubs or CS programs.
	9.	**Stakeholders**: Governments, Corporations, Youth.
