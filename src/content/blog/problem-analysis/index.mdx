According to <a href="https://datareportal.com/global-digital-overview#:~:text=There%20are%205.64%20billion%20internet,higher%20in%20many%20developing%20economies." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DataReportal</a>, **5.64 billion people** have access to electronic devices like iPads and phones, which have both pros and cons. Technology **makes communication much easier**, **increases efficiency** in corporations and governments, and is a great help for many people.

This can have **negative health effects** like causing difficulty in sleeping, increase in anxiety, and many others.
