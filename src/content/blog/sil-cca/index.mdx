**SIL and CCA with incentives**
    1. Student leaders can liaise with school leaders to push out these programs, and advocate for funds and resources to be set aside for these.
    2. Attempt to utilise existing programs and build on them/adapt them to utilise our incentive system.
    3. Students will be strongly encouraged to take part.
    4. Students will be able to pick which ones they are interested in, so as to make them more motivated and engaged, and hence allow these initiatives to have a greater impact on reducing students' use of social media.
    5. Incentives can be both monetary and non-monetary:  
        - **Monetary**: class parties, outings  
        - **Non-monetary**: reflection in official records (similar to how you have a column in records for LEAPS/CCA)
    6. The government can integrate the SIL recognition into LEAPS records and provide the administrative support necessary.
    7. **Adaptability**: Inclusion of liaising with school leaders as well as amendments to include non-monetary incentives to fit the specific needs of different schools.
    8. **Sustainability**: Students will always have hobbies, and this initiative grants them formal recognition and encourages them to pursue them further instead of using social media.
    9. **Stakeholders**: Government, youths.
    10. [Research shows](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9156660/) that replacing social media usage with physical activity improves emotional well being.
