## Publicity efforts to raise awareness of the harmful effects of doom scrolling
1. Student leaders can upload awareness posts on the school’s student council’s social media account 
2. Collaborate with schools to request for corporations who specialise in raising awareness to come give talks in schools
3. Use the school’s social media page to recognise those who have made significant progress in their CCA/ SIL and the people who have the least social media usage every week
4. This enhances the positive effects of social media use while educating the students on the negative impacts 
5. Collaborate with governments, and make this issue a national priority.                                      
6. Workers and corporations can work with schools to give talks to raise awareness of the harmful effects of social media
7. **Amendments**: Inclusion of promotion of CCA/ SIL on social media page + greater use of existing school social media pages
8. **Sustainability**: Most students will always follow schools’ official social media accounts, and the publicity efforts only require student leaders to make the post recognising achievements. 
9. **Stakeholders**: Youths/ workers/ corporations
