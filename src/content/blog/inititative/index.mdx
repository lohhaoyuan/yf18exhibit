## Taking initiative while with family and friends to stop overusing technology
1. Studentsâ€™ addiction to social media leads them to spend excessive amounts of time on social media, even when with friends or family
2. As people with influence over their peers, student leaders can make a conscious effort to avoid such use of social media when with their friends
3. Make a personal effort to stop using social media all the time when around friends and family
4. Avoid normalising a culture in which people are always on social media and not present
5. **Sustainability**: This requires no funds, and only requires us as student leaders to make a conscious effort to reduce our use of social media, especially when out and about with family and friends          
6. **Stakeholders**: Youths
